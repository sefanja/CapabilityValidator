# CapabilityValidator

**CapabilityValidator** is a validation tool for *Business Capability Models* built in [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/), using the [jArchi](https://github.com/archimatetool/archi-scripting-plugin) scripting plugin and [Ampersand](https://www.ampersandtarski.org/) as formal constraint engine.

It supports **incremental modeling** and helps architects maintain structural and semantic consistency across multiple decomposition levels of business capabilities, value streams, and business objects.

## 🎯 Purpose

Frameworks like **TOGAF** and **BIZBOK** promote capability-based planning and value stream modeling, but lack concrete rules for consistency and model integrity.  **CapabilityValidator** fills that gap by:

- Checking consistency of capability hierarchies (e.g. decomposition, unique parent)
- Validating object usage, value stream alignment, and cross-level access
- Allowing **partial models** to be validated incrementally
- Providing fast feedback **inside Archi** without requiring model completion

## ▶️ Typical usage

1. Open Archi, select one or more views or folders
2. Run the `CapabilityValidator` script via jArchi
    - Exports the selected parts of the model as Ampersand ADL
    - Generates relevant rules based on your selection
    - Reports violations directly in the jArchi console
3. Review validation results in the console

## 📟 Example console output

```
Validating 109 elements and 196 relationships in [archimate-diagram-model: N3 value stream P.A] against C0, C1, C2, C3, C6_L3, C7_L3, C8_L3, C9_L3, C10_L3, C11_L3, C12_L3, C13_L3:

C:\Users\UserName\Downloads\CapabilityValidator\output\rules.adl:169:1 error:
  There is a violation of RULE C10_association_allowed:
    ("Customer", "Employee")
------------------------------
C:\Users\UserName\Downloads\CapabilityValidator\output\rules.adl:175:1 error:
  There is a violation of RULE C12_serving_mirrorred_by_association:
    ("Serve Customers", "Invoice and Collect")
ExitFailure 10

Validation completed.
```

## 🧪 What it checks

- **C1**: Each element (*business function*, *business object*, *business process*) has at most one parent.
- **C2**: No element can be its own ancestor.
- **C3**: All leaf elements share the same decomposition level.
- **C4**: If two elements have a relationship other than composition, their parents (if any) must as well.
- **C5**: If two elements have a relationship, at least one pair of children (if any) must as well.
- **C6**: Each business function must access at least one business object.
- **C7**: Each business object must be accessed by at least one business function.
- **C8**: Each business process is aggregated by exactly one business function.
- **C9**: Each business function must either (1) aggregate a business process or (2) serve another function, potentially through multiple serving relationships, that aggregates a business process.
- **C10**: An association relationship between business objects is allowed if they are accessed (1) by the same business function, (2) by functions with a serving relationship in the opposite direction, or (3) by functions that aggregate business processes with a common ancestor.
- **C11**: Business functions that access a common business object must (1) have a serving relationship to at least one other business function that accesses the same object, or (2) aggregate busines processes with a common ancestor.
- **C12**: Each serving relationship between business functions must have a corresponding association relationship between business objects in the opposite direction.
- **C13**: At least one business object per descendant of a business process must be part of a connected graph.

## 🔧 Requirements

- [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/)
- [jArchi plugin](https://github.com/archimatetool/archi-scripting-plugin)
- [Ampersand](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/Ampersand)


## 📦 Installation

All files should be placed in a folder on your system, for example:
```
C:\Users\UserName\Downloads\CapabilityValidator\
```
Folder contents after installation:
```
CapabilityValidator/
├── validator.js        # jArchi script
├── ampersand/
│   └── ampersand       # Ampersand binary (.exe for Windows)
└── output/             # Ampersand ADL files (created after first run)
    ├── model.adl       # The selected Archi model subset in ADL format
    └── rules.adl       # The applicable Ampersand rules
```

### 1. jArchi script installation
To use the `validator.js` script inside Archi:
1.  Open Archi
2.  Go to `Scripts → Scripts Manager`, and click **New Archi Script**
3.  Name the new script `CapabilityValidator.ajs`
4.  In the script editor, paste the following line (adjust the path if needed):
	```javascript
      load('C:/Users/UserName/Downloads/CapabilityValidator/validator.js');
5.  Save the script

### 2. Ampersand setup
Manually download and extract the [Ampersand binaries](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/Ampersand/releases) and place them in the `ampersand/` directory as shown above.
